Use cases describe in detail **how we implemented a feature, a module or a web application in platformOS**.

They describe the problem, the challenges and solutions, and always provide insight into our decision-making process: Why did we decide for one solution over the other? What factors did we consider? What are the current industry best practices?

Use cases include links to:

* related documentation topics
* resources related to the topic (e.g. articles)
* all assets we used (e.g. templates)
* example code in our GitHub repository
* live demo
