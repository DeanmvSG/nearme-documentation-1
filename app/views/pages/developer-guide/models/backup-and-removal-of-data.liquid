This article describes how removed data is backed up just in case and when it is removed permanently.

## What is deleted_at

Every record that you create in our database has couple properties built-in. One of those properties is `deleted_at` which is `null` when record is created.
When you delete a record using , our system by default is filling this property with a datetime of the delete operation.

For example, you can delete record:

```graphql
mutation DefaultDelete {
  model_delete(id: "3") {
    deleted_at
  	id
  }
}
```

From now on, most GraphQL queries will not show those records anymore. You can get them again by filtering records by existing `deleted_at` property (`deleted_at: { exists: true }`).

Fo example:

```graphql
query models {
  models(
    per_page: 10
    filter: {
      deleted_at: { exists: true }
    }
  ) {
    results {
      deleted_at
      id
    }
  }
}
```

## Automatic delayed permanent removal

After 30 days of the date set in `deleted_at`, it will be permanently deleted, at 5am UTC.

For example, if `deleted_at` is `2020-03-15T14:28:48.153Z` (15 March 2020, 14:28 PM), record will be deleted 30 days later at 5am (14 April 2020, 5 AM). Until this date you can still recover it by setting `deleted_at` to `null`.

{% include 'alert/warning', content: 'If record has been permanently deleted, you will not be able to recover it in any way.' %}

## Manual permanent removal

You can force permanent removal by setting `deleted_at` value to date more than 30 days ago.

For example:

You want the record to be deleted as soon as possible.
Lets assume it is `30 April 2020`.
You would set `deleted_at` at date that is more than 30 days ago, for example `March 10`, which means it will be permanently deleted in the next purge process at 5am UTC.

```graphql
mutation Delete {
  model_update(
    id: "3"
    model: {
      deleted_at: "2020-03-15T14:28:48.153Z"
    }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

{% include 'alert/warning', content: 'If record has been permanently deleted, you will not be able to recover it in any way.' %}


## Undeleting data

If you want to bring back a record, you can nullify `deleted_at` and this record will not be marked as deleted.

```graphql
mutation Undelete {
  model_update(
    id: "3"
    model: { deleted_at: null }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

You can also set `deleted_at` to a different, future date to prolong its permanent removal, or move date backwards to speed up its removal.
