{% include 'alert/tip', content: 'If you go through the Hello, World! onboarding steps when registering on the Partner Portal,  you can download the codebase of your demo Instance instead of creating it with the pos-cli init command.' %} 

In order to correctly communicate with the platformOS engine and API, your codebase should be organized into a specific directory structure. The root directory of your project should contain the app directory. 

You can create the codebase using the pos-cli. Create a new directory for your project, and run the init command:

<pre class="command-line" data-user="user" data-host="host"><code class="language-bash">
pos-cli init
</code></pre>

This command creates the required directories, configuration files, and some example files in the directory you specified.{%- capture content -%}Make sure you invoke this command where you have permissions to create a directory.   
{%- endcapture -%}
{% include 'alert/important', content: content %} 

Once you've installed the required directory structure, locate and explore it â€“ this is how your codebase for your platformOS Instances should be organized. To learn more about the required directories and files, see [platformOS Codebase](/developer-guide/platformos-workflow/codebase).
