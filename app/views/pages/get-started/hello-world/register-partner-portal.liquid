The [Partner Portal](https://partners.platform-os.com/) is an online interface, where you can create, manage and configure your sites (called Instances), and create and manage the permissions of other users (called Partners).

Send us an email, or call us to register an account for you on the Partner Portal.

* Email: [support@platform-os.com](mailto:support@platform-os.com)
* Call: [+1-888-998-3375](tel:+18889983375)

Once registered, you will get an email invitation. Click on the `Accept invitation` link to activate your account. Clicking on the link redirects you to a page where you can set your password.

Enter a password in the `Password` field. Repeat your password in the `Password confirmation` field. Click on the `Set my password` button.

If the two passwords you entered match, you are logged in to the Partner Portal.
