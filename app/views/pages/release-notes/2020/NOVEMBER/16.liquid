<h4 class="release-note release-note__improved">IMPROVED</h4>

* [EXPERIMENTAL] new routing engine, which allows to use named parameters in slug. Deployed to staging. See [routing improvements details](https://github.com/mdyd-dev/platformos-documentation/issues/1279)
* properties with type `array` will have default value `[]` instead of `null`
* allow to undelete Page

<h4 class="release-note release-note__fixed">FIXED</h4>

* edge case scenario when legacy `slug` user property was changed even if `first_name` and `last_name` where not
* `asset_update` mutation failing in some edge case scenarios
* `hash_assign` failing without proper description in case of syntax error
* `admin_pages` GraphQL query when `handler` field was included in the result set
* sorting by property in GraphQL queries will put `null` values correctly at the beginning/at the end
