Sometimes you want to share Youtube video on your website, instead of just pasting a link. Youtube have

The problem with it is that it will load over 1.5 MB of scripts (including tracking code), styles, html even if user is not interested in the video at all.

### Default

This is the default embed code that is proposed by youtube:

```html
<iframe
  width="560"
  height="315"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/evezbNPC0Mo"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```

### Low-tech solution

There is a pretty nice workaround to provide visually pleasing video for your user, without making the site slow and heavy. You can use thumbnail from Youtube and link it to the video, so the user would click an image and go to Youtube to watch the video.

```html
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evezbNPC0Mo" target="_blank">
  <img src="images/thumbnail.jpg" alt="Town Hall #77 - How platformOS cloning revolutionized web development">
</a>
```

Example:

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evezbNPC0Mo" target="_blank">
  <img src="{{ 'images/best-practices/performance/embedding-youtube/thumbnail.jpg' | asset_url }}" alt="Town Hall #77 - How platformOS cloning revolutionized web development">
</a>

### High-tech solution

Now there is a better way: **[Lite YouTube Embed](https://github.com/paulirish/lite-youtube-embed)**

Lite YouTube Embed is a script that registers custom element in the browser. This element is showing youtube player very similar to original, but:

1. It is not downloading anything but thumbnail until user clicks play
2. It is using `youtube-nocookie.com` domain instead of `youtube.com`, which strips out tracking cookies, preserving your users privacy
3. According readme, because of deferred loading of resources, it renders 224x faster than original player

To be able to use this custom element in its full potential, you need it's CSS (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulirish/lite-youtube-embed/master/src/lite-yt-embed.css) and [javascript](https://github.com/paulirish/lite-youtube-embed/blob/master/src/lite-yt-embed.js) loaded on your website.

The custom element is straight forward to use:

```html
<lite-youtube videoid="evezbNPC0Mo">
</lite-youtube>
```
